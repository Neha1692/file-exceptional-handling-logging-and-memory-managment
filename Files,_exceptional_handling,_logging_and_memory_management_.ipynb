        "Q1-What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Compiled language: The program is translated into machine code before execution, allowing the processor to execute it directly. Example:C,C++, and Java\n",
        "Interpreted languages: Instructions are executed directly without prior compilation into machine code. The source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Example: Python, Ruby and java script.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2-What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Exeption handling is the process of responding to the occurence of exceptions during program execution. It helps prevent program crashes by gracefully managing errors. The try and except blocks are used to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3-What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The finally block is always executed regardless of whether an exception occured or not. It is used for cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4-What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Logging is a way to track events that happen when a program runs. It is useful for debugging and monitoring applications.\n",

        "from module import item:Imports specific items (functions,classes) from a module, which can be accessed directly without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7-How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Multiple except blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions. A general execpt block can be used to catch any exception not caught by specific except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8-What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The with statement ensures that resources are properly managed by automatically closing them, even if exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9-What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Multiple threads run within the same process, sharing the same memory space. It is suitable I/O- bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiple processes run independently, each with its own memory space. It is suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10- What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Advantages of logging:\n",
        " 1. Debugging: Logs help track program execution, identify errors and pinpoint problems, especially in complex applications.\n",
        " 2. Monitoring: Logs provide insights into program behaviour, allowing you to monitor performance and identify potentioal issues proactively.\n",
        " 3. Auditing: Logs can be used to track user actions and system events, useful for security and compliance purpose.\n",
        " 4. Configurability: Logging levels allow you to control the verbosity of logs and filter information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11- What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Python uses a private heap for managing objects and data structures. The Python memory manager handles allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12- What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-1. try Block:Encloses the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "    2. except Block: Handles specific exceptions that may occur within the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13- Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Memory management important in python for Performance, Resource Utilization, Program Stability, Debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14- What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The try block allows you to anticipate potential errors and handle them gracefully.\n",
        "The except block catches exceptions that occur within try block , preventing the program from crashing and allowing you to take corrective action.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15- How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Python's garbage collector uses reference counting to track the number of references to an object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, the garbage collector automatically frees the memory occupied by that object.Python also uses a cyclic garbage collector to handle circular references, where objects reference each other preventing memory leak.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16- What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The else block in exception handling executes only if no exceptions are raised within the try block.It is used to execute code that should only run if the code in the try block executes successfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17- What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- DEBUG:Detailed information for debugging purposes.\n",
        "     INFO:General information about program execution.\n",
        "     WARNING:Indicates potential problems or issues.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q18- What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the existing one, while multiprocessing provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing processes, offering better support for parallelism and avoiding some of the complexities of fork.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19- What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Closing a file releases the resources held by the file object, ensuring that changes are written to disk and preventing potential data corruption or resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20- What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-file.read() reads the entire file content of a file as a single string.\n",
        "file.readline() reads a single line from the file, including the newline character at the end.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21- What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting event messages from python programs, offering different severity levels and output options.It is used for tracking events that occur during the execution of software.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22- What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Q23- What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Challenges include memory leaks due to circular references the overhead of garbage collection, and the potential for high memory consumption in certain applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24-How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword, followed by the exception class or instance. for example:raise ValueError(\"invalid value)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25-Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-Multithreading allows for concurrent exection of code, improving performance in applications that involve I/O operations, network requests, or tasks that can be parallelized. It can also enhance responsiveness in user interfaces by preventing blocking operations from freezing the application."
